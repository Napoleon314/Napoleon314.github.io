The development of Venus3D ([https://github.com/Napoleon314/Venus3D][venus3d]) project aims to achieve a fashionable real-time 3D graphics engine for next generation rendering APIs such as Direct3D12, Vulkan, or Metal of Apple, which may release authentic power of multi-core CPU and asynchronous computing ability of modern GPU. Up to now, the moment I started to write this blog post, I have finished several useful wheel in the project, and I am about to code for the first hello-world rendering window. This is the first diary to introduce the idea and vision about this project.

# Motivation

I have been a programmer of 3D graphics for over seven years. I was coding for mmo-rpg online games, mobile phone games, but now I am studying the master of computer science in University of Wollongong in Australia. I need something to develop for keeping the status of programming, and I need my own wheels to build up high performance applications. So, I decide to rewrite my 2D engine for 3D rendering. This is a big challenge for me, because of the massive workload of that, but I believe that the development of Venus3D will make me stronger in programming. On the other hand, it is also a chance to tidy my accumulated code. Of course, beautiful graphics display is always inspiring me so much.
