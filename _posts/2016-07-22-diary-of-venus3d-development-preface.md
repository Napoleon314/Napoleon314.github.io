The development of Venus3D ([https://github.com/Napoleon314/Venus3D][venus3d] project aims to achieve a fashionable real-time 3D graphics engine for next generation rendering APIs such as Direct3D12, Vulkan, or Metal of Apple, which may release authentic power of multi-core CPU and asynchronous computing ability of modern GPU. Up to now, the moment I started to write this blog post, I have finished several useful wheel in the project, and I am about to code for the first hello-world rendering window. This is the first diary to introduce the idea and vision about this project.
